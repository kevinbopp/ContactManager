SearchContact:
    - Requires a JSON package sent to SearchContact.php  containing:
        > search containing the query (use "" for same as ListContacts)
        > "userID" containing this user's account ID numValue
    - returns:
        - A JSON array that's either [] (no contacts found) or each element contains:
            - "ID": contactID,
            - "userID": thisUserAccount,
            - "FirstName": "ContactFirstName",
            - "LastName": "ContactLastName",
            - "Email": "ContactEmail@email.com",
            - "Phone": "Contact54884Phone"
    - PSST: ListContacts is IDENTICAL when passed "" but does not send back userID.

Tell, we can probably get rid of ListContacts, it's the same as SearchContact when you pass ""
(the emtpy string) to SearchContact! Neither of them use lazy loading right now.
            
AddContact:
    - Requires a JSON sent to AddContact.php containing:
        > A "userID": numValue
        > The contact info to add to this user, including the:
            - firstName ""
            - lastName ""
            - email "(blah@email.end)"
            - phone "(111-111-1111)"
        > Currently, duplicate contacts are allowed.
        > Returns: If added successfully, returns all of these exact fields in the same order back
        plus "error": "". Empty string.
        > It's possible to make EVERY FIELD BLANK right now; fix that in JS.
            

DeleteContact:
    - This does not work, it says "Contact Deleted Succesfully" no matter what you type into body.
    If I provide it NO user ID and ID, it says that.
    - This needs to accept someone's username and password, verify they're logged in,
    THEN it needs to accept their userID (account) and contact ID to delete and actually delete it
    with DELETE FROM Contacts WHERE ID=###; and ### is "ID" (not userID).
    Currently returns
        - "id": 0 (why???)
        - "firstName": "", (why, empty string)
        - "lastName": "", (why, empty string)
        - "error": "", (again empty string)
        - "message": "Contact Deleted Succesfully!"

EditContact (DOES NOT CHECK IF LOGGED IN BEFORE EDITING)
    - Send EditContact.php a JSON containing:
        - "userID": accountIDNumValue
        - "id": contactIDNumValue
        - "firstName" new first name of contact or make sure you keep same
        - "lastName" new last name of contact or make sure you keep same
        - "email" new email or keep same
        - "phone" new phone or keep same
            > Be sure to make an edit page that grabs all of this info of the contact you're editing
            and fills out the fields in case the user only wants to edit 1 field.
        - Returns with "message": "Contact Updated Succesfully!" even if UserID wrong or if fields
          are left blank...

ListContacts
    - Just send "userID", returns a list of all contacts belonging to that user.
        > DOES THIS CURRENTLY RETURN MORE THAN 10? LIST SHOULD DO 10 AT A TIME,
        THIS IS WHAT WE CURRENTLY USE.
            - Make it so when you search, it always overrides results with searchcontact.
            - Make it so when you clear your search, does it...go back to showing 10 contacts?
    - if userID is not found OR user has no contacts, returns [] (empty array)
    - if userID has >= 1 contact, returns:
        > A JSON array, where each element in the array contains:
            "ID": contactIDNumber
            "FirstName": "ContactFirstName"
            "LastName": "ContactLastName"
            "Email": "contact@email.com"
            "Phone": "whateverIsStoredInHereLike000-123-4567or0000000000"
        - This return is identical to SearchContact except it does not send back userID after ID.
    

Register:
    - Send, word for word:
        "FirstName" "nameHere" "LastName" "nameHere" "Username" "userhere" "Password" "passhere"
        May receive an "error": "This Username is already in use"
        Else this returns "info": "Registration Successful!"

login.php:
    - Send "Username" and "Password"
    - Returns "id" numVal, "firstName" "accountFirstName", "lastName" "accountLastName", "error" ""
        > "error" is "No Records Found" if invalid username/password combo entered.

Clear function should wipe all contacts off the page before a fresh search/list.
Don't allow fields to be left blank? Or do???
